Inverted Triangle CSS - is a school of thought, way of thinking.

This methodology doesnt ignore css 'features' like cascading

Idea is to go from generic ---> to explicit, far-reaching ---> localised
Each layer is more and more explicit

Settings: Global vars, config switches
Tools: Default mixins and functions (reusable chunks of code, mediaQuerry wrappers)
Generic: Ground-zero styles: normalize, box sizing
Elements: Unclassed HTML elements // how element looks without class on it
Objects: abstract objects // ui-list, button
Components: carousel, button // becomes specific object (button etc)
Trumps: helpers, overrides

We affect smaller and smaller bits of the DOM at a time

Adding styles, not undoing
