CSS fault

The cascade and inheratence
Very loose
Highly dependent on source order
Not very expressive
Lots of gotchas
Specificity - large selectotrs

Our fault

Lack of documentation
Lack of structure, quality assurance (No paradigms telling where to look for certain things)
Mixture of abilities (Writing code in different standard)
Lack of knowledge about CSS / project (cant find variable, rewriting things which are already done)
Different styles, preferences of coding developers
Not aware of what exists already
Adding new styles to the end of stylesheets

Every piece of css has a potential to pass some information on or accept information from
another bit of css. It is giant global dependency mess (tree).

Ways of ordering:
Mirror the webpage - bad because is not how css works
Thematic chuncs - typography, forms, buttons, etc

Line througs in inspector are BAD. Its idea of Undoing CSS - writing more css in order to undo other css
Its rtiting more css to do less styling and is very inefficient

Specificity can completely ruin everything. Low Specificity = more elements.
To solve specificity issue, should write css in a specificity order
ITCSS tries to organise files by their specificity
